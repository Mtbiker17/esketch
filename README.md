This is an Odin Project assignment to create a UI for an Etch-A-Sketch program.

The program will be written to allow the user to use the mouse to draw a picture in a given grid. I'd like to challenge myself
a little further by making the grid adjustable, as well as some toggle options such as color selection.

What I learned:

- Some work in regular expressions
- new methods for JavaScript (.exec, .match, parseInt, setProperty, .floor)
- Slightly more understanding for arrow functions
- Better understanding of display:flex and using CSS custom propoerties
- use of CSS grid
- Proper googling to search for solutions and tailoring them to your own code
